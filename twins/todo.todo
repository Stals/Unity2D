  ☐ background!
  ☐ spawn waves
    ☐ 3 group types inside object somewhere off screen in disabled state
    ☐ spawn off screen
    ☐ think about
      ☐ do they spawn at the same time
      ☐ do they spawn over time
      ☐ do few patters spawn at the same time? 
      ☐ how much every time, what is the delta time between. 
        ☐ number of patterns per spawn   (----- every 4 waves, number of patterns per spawn increases. )
        ☐ number of spawns per wave
        ☐ delta time between spawns
      ☐ does wave end then you killed every one, or it has its time as well ---- every one
      ☐ do we give new weapon for every new wave and you need to adapt, or you collect boxes to get more poins? ---- every new wave
      ☐ it will be both cool if
        ☐ 1) severals packs come out at once

    ☐ draw
      ☐ bow
      ☐ arrow
    ☐ shoot using mouse and R2
  ☐ ranged enemies
    ☐ move towards you before in range, but more (because other way the will always move a bit, some the need to move closer then they need to)
    ☐ archers slowly retreat if you are comming closer
      ☐ just Translate (-movementSpeed / 2) (is closer than x)
  ☐ shield on the back
  ☐ spawn противника рандомного размера раз в заданое время?
  ☐ harder waves over time
    ☐ waves spawn faster & faster
    ☐ more packs per wave
  ☐ enemy size - affect how mush apply force is applied
  ☐ take damage + screenshake (how much - take from shoot upgr repeat)
  ☐ enemies take damage depending on weapon @together1
  ☐ improve enemies get hit apply force
  ☐ change weapon after wave
  ☐ try trail effect
    ☐ local position / rotation trail renderer
    ☐ mb http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=OptimizedTrailRenderer
    ☐ trails from here 
        http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Scripts/Effects
  ✔ animation when the die? @done (15-01-18 22:08)
  ☐ // enemies hit screenshake should depend on weapon strength - as well as knock back @together1
  ☐ насколько отлетают противники зависит от их размера 
  ☐ need to add some effect before enemies shoot - so you can evade!!!! 
    ☐ bow flashing
  ☐ weapon affects running speed (dagger the fastest, pike next) @together1
  ☐ enemies steering behaviour (imporoved)

    ☐ small enemies going around the really big one, and go for you, when you get closer (so that you would need to lure part of them at a time) 
  ☐ random number of normals become rangers?
  ☐ random numebr of anything becomes boss monster
  ☐ boss monsters (blue)
    ☐ drop more, have more hp
  ☐ upgrades, do you become more powerful?
      ☐  i would like it to be outside, so that you can improve 
      ☐ heath, 
      ☐ speed, 
      ☐ damage multiplier, 
      ☐ money multiplier (by increasing starting difficulty?)
      ☐ ability to start from wave N
find:
  ☐ unity 2d background shader

ideas:
  ☐ if you spin you get more damage
  ☐ after spining with a big weapon it moves you forward
  ☐ slice arrows? (with 2 weapon guy)
  ☐ super cratebox mechanic for chaning weapons during combat?
  ☐ boss type
      ☐ different color, have bigger hp
  ☐ ai ideas
    ☐ move to the back
    ☐ try avoiding the weapon
  ☐ changing sizeType changes them in sceene as well
  ☐ special waves
     ☐ position dependant
       ☐ around the screen, that come from all sides at once, and you need to go for one side and then move away @cool
   ☐ ability to reflect arrows with daggers and double sabers @cool
   ☐ спавн нормального противника раз в заданое время
   ☐ противников должно заносить , тогда они могут быть быстрее (steering behaviour / seeking behaviour)
       ☐ http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-steering-behaviors-seek--gamedev-849
   ☐ weapn special ability (probably no)
     ☐ pike - dash forward (without taking damage)
     ☐ 

 think:
   ☐ why big one is a threat?
     ☐ (you do not apply force to him, but you can easily run away so whats the point?)
     ☐ some reason why you need to kill him not last while defending from archers ext, will be cool.
        ☐ does he spawn enemies?
          ☐ aka he will spawn a lot if you dont kill him fast
          ☐ small ones?
          ☐ with animation (i will spawn now - he increases in size for some time, and then spawns.)
