	improvements:
	- when fake blocks spawn - first make them go bigger and then reduce in size
	- screen shake when matching > 5 tiles (increasing with more you match)
	- write how big combo is
	- increase particle size

	try:
	- elastic for droping blocks

game design:
- antisocial tiles or option to reduce social
- add something to allow choice (currently you just match what you see)
	- and showing the combo will make it worse probably

tutorial:
-! after clicking on a tile - start spinning right away
- show diagonals are possible
- what (-h means)
- how health works
